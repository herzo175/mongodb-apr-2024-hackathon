1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,920
this stage for two-nil

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,600
they've taken their chance and liverpool

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,879
getting the better of just again they

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,000
made a

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,679
number of good saves in the second

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,280
period

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,320
messi

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,480
oh my goodness

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
oh my goodness

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,720
just when you think he's done everything

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,560
he comes up with something even more

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,359
special to catch allison out

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,400
and to make it three nil

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,800
well to beat i'll listen from there i've

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,360
got to say i mean he smiles it takes

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,640
some doing

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,600
and perhaps only that fella could do it

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,640
i mean if you wanted to go and place it

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360
in the corner i don't think you could do

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
much better job

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,960
